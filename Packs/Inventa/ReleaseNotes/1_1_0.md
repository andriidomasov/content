#### Incident Fields
##### New: **Inventa Source**
- Reflects Source entity containing single piece of data pertaining to a datasubject. 

#### Incident Types
- **iDSAR**
- Updated playbook for work within new API scope.

#### Integrations
- **1Touch.io's Inventa Connector (Partner Contribution)**
- Integration is updated to work with PII-API instead of DSAR-API. Previously used DSAR API will no longer be updated in future releases of Inventa, thus 
the further updates will use only the PII API. All the relevant workflow including playbooks and constraints are updated accordingly.

#### Layouts
- **Inventa DSAR Layout**
- Removed from Inventa DSAR Layout fields "Inventa DSAR Ticker" and "Inventa DSAR Reason" since same are no longer required for proper workflow.

#### Playbooks
- **DSAR Inventa Handler**
- Updated playbook for work within new API scope.
